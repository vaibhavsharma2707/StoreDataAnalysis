In this Power Bi Project, we will be doingÂ  data analysis for Super store Data .
We have Six CSV files-
1.Sales
2.Stores
3.Customers
4.Data Dictionary
5.Exchange Rates
6.Products.


When you load the files in Power BI,raw data has some errors.We need to review all the files for any issues (duplicacy,empty fields,error values).


Cleaning & Transforming-
1.Removing errors in "Sales" File.
2.Removing empty values in "Sales" file for Delivery Date".
3.Changing date type format for "Delivery Date" from text to Date in "Sales" file.
4.Making first row as header in "Data Dictionary".
5.Value of "Cost per unit" & "Price per unit" is in Text due to "$" sign,split the Column through Delimiter,which will create the column in Number data type.


Using DAX queries for making additional columns-
(a)Sales-
1.Getting Delivery time(Order date-delivery date)-
DeliveryTime = DATEDIFF('Sales'[Order Date],'Sales'[Delivery Date],DAY)


(b)Customers-
1.Calculating Age from Birth Date -
Age = DATEDIFF('Customers'[Birthday],TODAY(),YEAR)


(c)Products-
1.Calculating Profit per unit-
Profit per Unit = 'Products'[Unit Price USD]-'Products'[Unit Cost USD]


(d)Stores-
1.Identifying Type based on size of store-
Store Size = SWITCH(
TRUE(),
'Stores'[Square Meters]<=800,"Small",
'Stores'[Square Meters]<=1600 && 'Stores'[Square Meters]>=800,"Medium",
'Stores'[Square Meters]>=1600,"Big",
"unknown"
)
